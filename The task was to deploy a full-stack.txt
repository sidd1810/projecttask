The task was to deploy a full-stack MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) application in a professional and automated way. First, I created a GitHub repository and pushed the complete project code, which included separate frontend and backend directories. Then, I containerized the application by writing Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend, built Docker images, and pushed them to Docker Hub. Next, I set up an Ubuntu virtual machine on a cloud platform and used Docker Compose to deploy the application, ensuring both the frontend and backend ran as containers. For the database, I chose either to install MongoDB directly on the VM or use the official MongoDB Docker image as part of Docker Compose.

 I also configured a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins (or GitHub Actions), which automatically builds updated Docker images when code is pushed, pushes them to Docker Hub, and redeploys the containers on the VM. Finally, I set up Nginx as a reverse proxy so the entire application could be accessed through port 80, giving a single entry point for users. The task required documentation, including Dockerfiles, Docker Compose file, CI/CD configuration, and screenshots demonstrating the pipeline execution, Docker image deployment, and working application interface.

 The only minor issue I faced was with the Jenkinsfile, which I corrected to ensure smooth automation of the CI/CD process.
